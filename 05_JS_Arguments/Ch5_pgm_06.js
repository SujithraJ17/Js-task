/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Use the showSum function to add 56 and 74.
 *
 * To multiply two numbers, use the * symbol.
 * e.g. 3 * 5 is 3 multiplied by 5.
 *
 * 2) Create a showProduct function to multiply two numbers.
 *
 * 3) Use your function to multiply three pairs of numbers.
 *
 * To divide one number by another, use /.
 * e.g. 10 / 2 is 10 divided by 2.
 *
 * 4) What about showDifference and showQuotient
 *    for subtraction and division?
